# Maritime SOF Analytics 🚢

**Live Demo:** [**https://project-sof-analysis.netlify.app/**](https://project-sof-analysis.netlify.app/)

A full-stack web application that transforms unstructured maritime Statement of Facts (SOF) documents into actionable, structured data. Upload PDF or DOCX files and instantly receive a detailed analysis, complete with an interactive events table and a dynamic Gantt chart timeline.



---

## 🚀 Key Features

-   **Intelligent Document Parsing**: Utilizes **LlamaParse** to accurately extract raw text content from complex PDF and DOCX documents.
-   **Advanced AI Data Structuring**: Employs a **dual-pass refinement strategy** with the **Google Gemini Pro** model. An initial extraction is critically reviewed and corrected by a second AI pass, ensuring maximum accuracy and completeness.
-   **Robust Backend API**: Built with **FastAPI** for high-performance, asynchronous handling of file uploads and processing. Data integrity is ensured using **Pydantic** schemas.
-   **Framework-Free Frontend**: A sleek, responsive, and fast user interface built with vanilla **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, demonstrating modern web capabilities without reliance on heavy frameworks.
-   **Rich Data Visualization**:
    -   **Detailed Table View**: A clear, color-coded table of all operational events.
    -   **Custom Gantt Chart**: A dynamic and interactive timeline visualizing the sequence and duration of events, built from scratch.
-   **Flexible Data Export**: Download the structured analysis in both **CSV** and **JSON** formats for seamless integration with other systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1.  **File Upload**: The user uploads one or more SOF documents through the web interface. The frontend provides drag-and-drop functionality and visual feedback.
2.  **Backend Processing**: The **FastAPI** server receives the files and saves them temporarily.
3.  **Text Extraction**: Each file is passed to the `document_parser`, which uses **LlamaParse** to extract clean, ordered text.
4.  **AI Structuring & Refinement**:
    -   The extracted text is sent to the `processor`, where the **Google Gemini** model performs a first pass to structure the data into a predefined JSON schema.
    -   A second, "adjudicator" prompt is then used. The AI is given the original text and both the first and second extraction attempts, and is tasked with resolving conflicts and merging the data to produce a final, highly accurate JSON object.
5.  **Data Visualization**: The final JSON is sent to the frontend. JavaScript dynamically renders the data into the dashboard on the `/data` page, populating the details card, events table, and the custom Gantt chart. Data is stored in `localStorage` to persist between pages.
6.  **Export**: The user can download the complete dataset as a CSV or JSON file, generated on-the-fly by the frontend.

## 📦 Setup and Local Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8+
-   `pip` package manager
-   A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the project to your local machine.

```bash
git clone [https://your-repository-url.com/maritime-sof-analytics.git](https://your-repository-url.com/maritime-sof-analytics.git)
cd maritime-sof-analytics/project-backend
````

### 2\. Set Up Environment Variables

This project requires API keys for LlamaParse and Google Gemini.

1.  Inside the `project-backend` directory, create a file named `.env`.
2.  Add your API keys to the `.env` file:
    ```env
    LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY="llx-..."
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="AIz..."
    ```

### 3\. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4\. Run the Application

Start the FastAPI backend server using Uvicorn. The `--reload` flag will automatically restart the server when you make changes to the code.

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 5\. Access the Web Interface

Once the server is running (you'll see `Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000`), open your web browser and navigate to:

**[http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)**

The FastAPI application is configured to serve all the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files from the `project-frontend` directory.
